# Box Testing

## Black Box Testing

Black box testing is a technique used to test a system/application's
functionality without knowing the internal code base. This focuses on inputs and
outputs to ensure a system behaves as expected.

You would use this type of testing for things like validating user interfaces
and external functions. It is particularly useful when you do not have access to
a function (like an external API).

## White Box Testing

White box testing is a method used to test the structures/workings of an
application as opposed to its functionality. A white box tester has access to
all the internal code and can test the application at a much deeper level. White
box testers can test things like internal algorithms and data structures.

This type of tester can be applied at the unit, integration, and system levels.

## Gray Box Testing

Gray box testing is a combination of white box and black box, it takes a hybrid
approach where the testers have limited knowledge of internal code, but enough
to define test cases. Gray box testers are allowed all the documentation linked
to the functions.
