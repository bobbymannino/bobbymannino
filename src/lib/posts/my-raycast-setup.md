# My Raycast Setup

## What is Raycast?

[Raycast](https://raycast.com), in my opinion, is the best best utility you can
get on macOS (soon for Windows). At its core it is a free spotlight replacement
but it is so much more than that. I've been using Raycast for over 4 years now
and I could not live a day without it. Raycast has a huge assortment of built-in
features such as window management, clipboard history, snippets, searching and
so much more. One of my favorite features is its OS level AI integration, you
have the ability to talk to AI anywhere with one hotkey.

## Extensions

Raycast is built on [React](https://react.dev) and because of that it has a
massive open source extension library. Some extensions I use are:

• [Google Fonts](https://www.raycast.com/GastroGeek/google-fonts) - Search
Google fonts

• [Zed](https://www.raycast.com/ewgenius/zed-recent-projects) - Open recent Zed
projects

• [Penpot](https://www.raycast.com/bobbymannino/penpot) - Open Penpot projects
(created by me)

• [Color Picker](https://www.raycast.com/thomas/color-picker) - Pick a color
from your screen

• [Coffee](https://www.raycast.com/mooxl/coffee) - Stop your Mac from sleeping

## Hotkeys

Raycast is extremely customizable and it is designed to be used with both
keyboard and mouse, but I try as much as I can to use the keyboard. Without the
mouse I can open apps, resize windows, search snippets/files, move windows and
much much more. There is a special key in Raycast called "Hyper Key". This is a
customizable key (e.g. Caps Lock, Left Shift, Right Control, etc) that you can
use to set up hotkeys, for instance I have my hyper key set to `Caps Lock` and I
use it to activate most of my shortcuts.

## Affiliate Link

Some of the features I have mentioned are limited in use or require a pro
subscription but if you use my [Affiliate Link](https://raycast.com/?via=bobby)
you can gain 10% off your subscription. If you decide against the pro version
you will still find Raycast an absolute game changer.
