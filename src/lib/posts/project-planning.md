# Project Planning

This blog post is by no means an instruction manual on how to plan a project. It
is just the way I go about planning a project and why.

## Step One: Requirements Gathering

### Don't Waste Time

Once you have been given a brief or a concept for a project or piece of work it
is then on you to gather the requirements. This is the most important step in
the project planning process as it sets the foundation for the rest of the
project. If you then start planning and developing based off of incomplete or
incorrect requirements, you risk wasting time and resources on features that
don't meet the needs of the end user, and the further you get without realizing
the more work has been done for nothing.

### What are the Requirements

The requirements of a project are not just what the client has asked you for,
but also technical, time, financial, legal, ethical and organizational. Some of
these may be given to you but more often they are not and it is up to you or
your team find these out yourselves.

the technical difficulties of a problem so it is important to communicate in an
effective but simple manor.-->
