# Which Editor

## VS Code

### Advantages

- Cross-platform
- Stable
- Vast amount of extensions
- Ease of use
- Intergrated into GitHub, head to a repo and click period on your keyboard
- Supports basically every language
- Intergrated Git control

### Disadvantages

- Slow due to being electron based
- Crowded, this can be a plus but for me I prefer a minimal IDE

## Vim

### Advantages

- Cross-platform
- Stable
- Quickest
- No need to install anything
- On every machine

### Disadvantages

- Learning curve

## Zed

### Advantages

- Cross-platform
- Quick as it's rust based
- Minimal

### Disadvantages

- Doesn't support too many extensions (at the time of writing it is still in
beta)

## What Do I Use?

I personally use Zed with vim mode enabled, this way I get the best of both
worlds. I end up with a nice and fast GUI using Zed, but also the quick keyboard
shortcuts using vim. There are many extensions for vim that can enable what Zed
do but for me I prefer the ease of zed, the extension store being one click, and
I always know how to exit Zed.
