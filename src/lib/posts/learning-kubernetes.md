# Learning Kubernetes

I was handed a project that in short required me to create a HTTP API that
authorized users from anywhere can access. For this post I will not go over the
API aspect of if and you can imagine the docker image `api-img:latest` is my
valid API image that exposes endpoints on port _3000_.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the
deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a
way to simply manage, scale and deploy applications and services.
