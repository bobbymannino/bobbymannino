# GitHub Actions

## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) service
provided by GitHub that allows you to automate workflows. It enables you to
build, test, deploy and much more directly from your GitHub repository. With
GitHub Actions, you can create custom workflows that respond to various events
in your repository, such as pushes, pull requests, or issues.

## Why use GitHub Actions?

GitHub actions is often the first choice for CI/CD because it is tightly
integrated with GitHub making it incredible easy and low friction to use.

## Create a Workflow?

A workflow is a configurable automated process made up of one or more jobs. A
workflow is defined in a specific directory `/.github/workflows` and each
workflow is defined in a separate YAML file. The workflow file contains the
following sections:

```yaml
