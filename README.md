Hi there, im a software engineering undergraduate at the university of Plymouth
and i love to create and code things.

I mainly use web technologies such as Svelte and Typescript but i am currently
trying to learn rust and get better equiped with postgres.

I love programming and hope that one day that will be my full time job.
