Hi there, im a software engineering undergraduate at the university of Plymouth
and i love to create and code things.

I mainly use web technologies such as Svelte and Typescript but i am currently
trying to learn rust and get better equiped with postgres.

I love programming and hope that one day that will be my full time job.

## Development

To run the site locally:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the environment variables
2. Install dependencies: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
3. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`

### Deployment Status

The site includes a deployment status badge in the footer that shows the current deployment status from Dokploy. To enable this feature, set the following environment variables:

- `PUBLIC_DOKPLOY_URL`: The URL of your Dokploy instance (e.g., `https://dokploy.example.com`)
- `PUBLIC_DOKPLOY_PROJECT_ID`: Your Dokploy project ID
- `PUBLIC_DOKPLOY_APPLICATION_ID`: Your Dokploy application ID

If these variables are not set, the deployment status badge will not be displayed.

configuration: solid, rounded, 3 radii, 2 line width.
